## TODO:

 * Use calibration/datasheets to create functions that convert voltages into
    temperature, acceleration, and angular velocity

 * Test the ability of the phase difference function to tell the difference between
    data taken at different temperatures

 * Develop a way to pull the frequency shift (acceleration) data out of the data
